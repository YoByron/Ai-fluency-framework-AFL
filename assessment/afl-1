# AFL-1 Assessment Rubric – AI User

## Overview
AFL-1 represents the **first stage of active AI use**. Citizens at this level should be able to **use AI tools for everyday tasks**, validate their outputs, and detect misinformation. This stage moves beyond awareness to **practical engagement** with AI, ensuring inclusivity across work and non-work domains.

---

## Core Competencies
- Perform **single-turn prompting** for useful outputs.  
- Apply AI to **basic task automation** (e.g., drafting, translation, summarization).  
- Validate outputs and detect hallucinations or errors.  
- Use AI responsibly in **multilingual and multimodal interactions**.  
- Apply AI in **non-work and personal contexts**, reflecting global adoption insights (OpenAI/NBER 2025: 70%+ non-work usage).

## Assessment Rubric

**1. Prompt Test**
- Task: Generate 5 useful outputs across civic, educational, and personal contexts.  
- **Threshold**: ≥4/5 outputs rated “useful” by evaluators.  

**2. Output Validation**
- Task: Detect hallucinations in 5 AI-generated responses.  
- **Threshold**: Correctly identify ≥4/5 inaccuracies.  

**3. Multilingual Application**
- Task: Use AI in at least 2 Indian languages for translation or voice interaction.  
- **Threshold**: ≥80% accuracy in comprehension and execution.  

**4. Non-Work Application**
- Task: Demonstrate one creative, personal, or civic AI use case (e.g., generating study notes, drafting letters, organizing community events).  
- **Threshold**: Practical application demonstrated with minimal errors.  

---

## KPIs
- **Population Target**: 500M AFL-1 certified citizens by 2030.  
- **Accuracy Goal**: ≥85% detection of hallucinations.  
- **Inclusivity Goal**: At least 40% adoption in rural/low-income areas (Anthropic 2025 insights).  
- **Usage Metric**: Evidence of both work-related and non-work adoption.  

---

## Tools
- **Proctored Online Tests**: Multiple-choice + scenario-based.  
- **Practical Demos**: Hands-on prompting and validation exercises.  
- **Peer Validation**: AFL-2 users validate AFL-1 tasks.  
- **Portfolios**: Documented examples of non-work and work-related AI use.  

---

## Outcome
By achieving AFL-1, citizens transition from awareness to **active and responsible use of AI**—developing the ability to automate tasks, validate AI outputs, and integrate AI into their daily lives while maintaining inclusivity and ethical awareness.
