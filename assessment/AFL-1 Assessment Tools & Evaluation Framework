# AFL-1 Assessment Tools & Evaluation Framework

## Assessment Philosophy

The AFL-1 assessment framework emphasizes **practical competency demonstration** rather than theoretical knowledge recall. Assessment is designed to be:

- **Authentic**: Real-world scenarios and applications
- **Adaptive**: Adjusts to learner's context and needs  
- **Inclusive**: Accessible across languages, cultures, and abilities
- **Ethical**: Integrates constitutional AI compliance throughout
- **Continuous**: Ongoing evaluation rather than single high-stakes testing

---

## Assessment Architecture

### Multi-Dimensional Competency Model

```
AFL-1 Competency = f(Technical Skills, Critical Thinking, Ethical Reasoning, Practical Application)

Where:
- Technical Skills (25%): Tool proficiency and operation
- Critical Thinking (25%): Evaluation and analysis capabilities  
- Ethical Reasoning (25%): Constitutional AI compliance and responsibility
- Practical Application (25%): Real-world problem solving and integration
```

# Simplified Adaptive Assessment Algorithm
def adaptive_assessment(learner_profile, current_competency, learning_objectives):
    """
    Adjusts assessment difficulty and focus based on learner progress
    """
    if current_competency < 0.6:
        return generate_foundational_questions(learning_objectives)
    elif current_competency < 0.8:
