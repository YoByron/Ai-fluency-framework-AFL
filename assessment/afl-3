# AFL-3 Assessment Rubric – AI Orchestrator

## Overview
AFL-3 represents the **orchestrator stage of AI fluency**, where learners move from validation to **strategic design, orchestration, and leadership**. Citizens at this level must be able to design multi-tool workflows, run policy simulations, develop curricula, optimize costs, and ensure **constitutional compliance** across deployments. AFL-3 practitioners are positioned as **innovation leaders, administrators, and policymakers** who can transform organizations and communities.

## Core Competencies
- **Multi-Tool Workflow Orchestration**: Integrate AI tools across domains for end-to-end task execution.  
- **Policy Simulation & Decision Support**: Model governance, education, and economic scenarios using AI.  
- **Curriculum & Strategy Development**: Create AI literacy programs and organizational deployment plans.  
- **Inference Cost Awareness**: Optimize AI deployments for cost efficiency (Stanford AI Index 2025).  
- **Adaptive Deployment**: Bridge the "GenAI divide" by piloting adaptive systems (MIT 2025).  
- **Leadership & Training**: Train large cohorts (≥20 AFL-2 validators).  
- **Constitutional AI Compliance**: Lead CACF implementation with measurable standards.

- Task: Design an end-to-end workflow using ≥3 AI tools.  
- **Threshold**: Demonstrated **≥30% efficiency gain** over baseline.  

**2. Policy Simulation**
- Task: Conduct a simulation (e.g., health, banking, education, agriculture).  
- **Threshold**: Present measurable impact projections and mitigation strategies.  

**3. Inference Cost Optimization**
- Task: Deploy AI models and compare costs across configurations.  
- **Threshold**: Achieve ≥10% reduction in inference costs while maintaining accuracy.  

**4. Adaptive Deployment**
- Task: Pilot a GenAI system addressing the adoption gap.  
- **Threshold**: Demonstrated ROI improvement or scaling success in production settings.  

**5. Leadership Training**
- Task: Train ≥20 individuals to AFL-2 competency and track certification success.  
- **Threshold**: ≥80% of trainees achieve AFL-2 within 12 months.  

**6. Compliance Oversight**
- Task: Implement CACF standards in one organizational AI deployment.  
- **Threshold**: 100% adherence to Articles 14, 15, and 21 requirements.

## KPIs
- **Population Target**: 20M AFL-3 certified citizens by 2035.  
- **Productivity Gains**: ≥20% measurable improvement in knowledge-intensive tasks (OpenAI/NBER 2025).  
- **Inference Cost KPI**: ≥10% cost reduction achieved.  
- **Policy Adoption**: At least 50% of AFL-3 orchestrators demonstrate impact on district/state policy.  
- **International Recognition**: AFL-3 certifications accepted by global organizations/universities.  

---

## Tools
- **Policy Simulators**: Digital twins for education, health, economy.  
- **Deployment Dashboards**: Real-time monitoring of efficiency, compliance, and costs.  
- **Leadership Portfolios**: Documentation of trained cohorts and orchestrated workflows.  
- **Compliance APIs**: Automated CACF check integration for workflows.
