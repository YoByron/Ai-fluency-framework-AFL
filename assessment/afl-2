# AFL-2 Assessment Rubric – AI Validator

## Overview
AFL-2 represents the **validator stage of AI fluency**. Citizens at this level should be able to **critically evaluate AI outputs, detect and mitigate bias, validate sources, and co-create with AI**. AFL-2 learners also begin to take on **teaching and leadership roles** by training others, integrating sector-specific applications, and aligning work with constitutional compliance.

## Core Competencies
- Conduct **multi-turn conversations** with AI for complex tasks.  
- Detect, analyze, and mitigate **bias in AI outputs**.  
- Validate sources and ensure **accuracy of information**.  
- Create AI-assisted content and **workflow improvements**.  
- Train others at AFL-1 competency level.  
- Apply **public sector functional competencies** (IndiaAI framework: procurement, governance).  
- Implement **sector-specific applications** (banking, manufacturing – NITI Aayog).

## Assessment Rubric

**1. Bias Detection & Mitigation**
- Task: Review 5 AI outputs for potential bias.  
- **Threshold**: Correctly identify bias in ≥4/5 outputs and propose mitigation strategies.  

**2. Source Validation**
- Task: Validate references in 10 AI-generated claims.  
- **Threshold**: ≥80% accuracy in validation.  

**3. Workflow Creation**
- Task: Design and document a workflow integrating AI (e.g., a procurement or governance task).  
- **Threshold**: Demonstrated **≥20% efficiency gain** compared to baseline.  

**4. Teaching Capability**
- Task: Train 5 individuals to AFL-1 competency and document outcomes.  
- **Threshold**: ≥80% of trainees successfully complete AFL-1 certification.  

**5. Sector-Specific Application**
- Task: Apply AI in one sector (banking, manufacturing, health, or agri).  
- **Threshold**: Demonstrated measurable productivity gain or risk reduction.

## KPIs
- **Population Target**: 100M AFL-2 certified citizens by 2032.  
- **Bias Accuracy Goal**: ≥85% accuracy in bias detection tasks.  
- **Validation Goal**: ≥80% correct validation of AI-provided references.  
- **Productivity Benchmark**: ≥2x improvement in sectoral pilot projects (NITI Aayog).  
- **Training Impact**: Each AFL-2 validator uplifts at least 5 AFL-1 learners.  

---

## Tools
- **Simulation Environments**: Sandbox for procurement, governance, and sectoral workflows.  
- **Bias Detection Modules**: Interactive exercises with diverse datasets.  
- **Peer Validation**: AFL-3 orchestrators audit AFL-2 outputs.  
- **Portfolio Evidence**: Documented co-created workflows and training activities.

## Outcome
By achieving AFL-2, citizens become **validators and multipliers** of AI fluency—ensuring that outputs are reliable, bias-free, and constitutionally compliant, while building the capacity of others. AFL-2 graduates strengthen the **trust and scalability** of human-AI collaboration across India.
