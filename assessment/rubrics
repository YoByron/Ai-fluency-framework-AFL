# AFL Assessment Rubrics – Updated with 2025 KPIs

## Overview
This document refines the assessment rubrics for AFL certification levels (0–3) by incorporating insights from 2025 AI reports (Stanford, Anthropic, OpenAI/NBER, MIT, NITI Aayog, IndiaAI). The goal is to align measurable competencies with global adoption trends, ensuring consistency, reproducibility, and real-world impact.

## AFL-0: AI Aware

**Core Competencies**
- Identify AI-generated content (text, image, audio, video).  
- Demonstrate awareness of uneven adoption trends globally and locally.  
- Recognize misinformation and deepfakes at a basic level.  

**Assessment Rubric**
- **Awareness Quiz**: ≥80% accuracy in identifying AI vs. human-generated content.  
- **Trend Literacy**: Correctly answer 3/4 questions on global adoption rates (e.g., 40% US adoption – Anthropic).  
- **Practical Test**: Identify 3/5 AI-generated deepfakes.  

**KPIs**
- 90% of candidates achieve ≥75% in awareness quiz.  
- 70% accuracy in uneven adoption case study scenarios.

## AFL-1: AI User

**Core Competencies**
- Use AI for single-turn prompting, task automation, and multilingual interaction.  
- Validate outputs and detect misinformation.  
- Apply AI in practical non-work and everyday scenarios (from OpenAI usage study).  

**Assessment Rubric**
- **Prompt Test**: Generate 5 useful outputs across domains.  
- **Validation**: Detect hallucinations in 4/5 AI responses.  
- **Practical Use**: Demonstrate one non-work application (creative, personal, or civic).  

**KPIs**
- 500M citizens AFL-1 certified by 2030.  
- ≥85% accuracy in hallucination detection.  
- Evidence of adoption across low-income/rural areas (tracking inclusivity).

## AFL-2: AI Validator

**Core Competencies**
- Conduct multi-turn conversations and validate AI outputs.  
- Detect and mitigate bias.  
- Create AI-assisted content and workflows.  
- Apply public sector functional competencies (IndiaAI: procurement, governance).  
- Integrate domain-specific applications (NITI: banking, manufacturing).  

**Assessment Rubric**
- **Bias Test**: Identify bias in ≥4/5 outputs.  
- **Source Validation**: Correctly validate 80% of AI-provided references.  
- **Workflow Creation**: Document one validated workflow with 20% efficiency gain.  
- **Competency Mapping**: Demonstrate application of functional/behavioral competencies.  

**KPIs**
- 100M certified by 2032.  
- 85% accuracy in bias detection.  
- 2x productivity improvement in pilot use cases (NITI Aayog benchmarks).

- Develop curriculum or organizational AI strategies.  
- Optimize inference costs and deployment models (Stanford AI Index).  
- Bridge GenAI divide by piloting adaptive systems (MIT).  
- Lead CACF compliance implementation.  

**Assessment Rubric**
- **Workflow Design**: End-to-end orchestration with ≥30% efficiency gain.  
- **Policy Simulation**: Model and present one real-world scenario with measurable impact.  
- **Cost Awareness**: Demonstrate inference optimization in deployment tasks.  
- **Leadership**: Train ≥20 individuals to AFL-2 competency.  

**KPIs**
- 20M certified by 2035.  
- 20% measurable productivity gain in knowledge-intensive tasks (OpenAI/NBER).  
- Evidence of cost efficiency: 10% reduction in inference expenses.  
- 85% of certified orchestrators apply AFL skills in organizational policy/governance.
