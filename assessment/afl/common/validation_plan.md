 # CAFF Assessment Validation Plan (Cross‑Tier)

Scope: Psychometric validation for AFL‑0..AFL‑5 instruments across languages and contexts.

- Design
  - Blueprint: constructs ↔ items/tasks; coverage ≥ 0.9
  - Forms: knowledge, performance, portfolio; parallel forms for re‑test
- Studies
  1) Pilot (n≥150 per locale): item difficulty/discrimination, alpha/omega
  2) Structure: EFA→CFA; CFI/TLI ≥ .90, RMSEA ≤ .08
  3) Rater: ICC ≥ .70; calibration and drift checks
  4) Fairness: DIF across gender/language/SES; mitigate/remove biased items
  5) Criterion: correlations with external outcomes (course/work KPIs)
- Operations
  - Versioning, secure item bank, rotation policy, breach response
  - Annual refresh with documented change log
- Reporting
  - Learner feedback, error bands, program dashboards
