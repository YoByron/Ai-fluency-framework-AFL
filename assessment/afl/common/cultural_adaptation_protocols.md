 # Cultural Adaptation Protocols (Assessments)

Follow these steps before local rollout; preserve construct while adapting surface features.

- Translate + transcreate; back‑translation checks on sampled items
- Cognitive labs (n=8–12): clarity, difficulty, cultural sensitivity
- Pilot (n≥100): reliability per subscale ≥ .75; screen DIF; revise/remove biased items
- Document adaptations; assign locale‑version; archive evidence memo
