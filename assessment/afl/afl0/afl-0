# AFL-0 Assessment Rubric – AI Aware

## Overview
AFL-0 represents the **foundational stage of AI fluency**. The goal is to ensure that every citizen above the age of 10 attains **basic awareness** of AI systems, their applications, and their societal impact. This level emphasizes recognition, awareness, and discernment rather than advanced usage.

## Core Competencies
- Recognize AI applications in everyday life.  
- Demonstrate **basic digital literacy** (navigation, safety, and ethical awareness).  
- Identify AI-generated vs. human-generated content (text, image, audio, video).  
- Detect misinformation and **basic-level deepfakes**.  
- Understand global adoption patterns and uneven diffusion (from Anthropic Economic Index 2025).

## Assessment Rubric

**1. Awareness Quiz**
- Format: 20-question multiple-choice test.  
- Topics: AI in daily life, examples of applications, responsible use.  
- **Passing Threshold**: ≥80% accuracy.  

**2. AI Content Identification**
- Task: Distinguish between 10 samples (text, image, audio, video).  
- **Threshold**: ≥80% correct classification.  

**3. Digital Safety & Ethics**
- Scenario-based questions (e.g., identifying phishing, privacy breaches).  
- **Threshold**: ≥75% correct responses.  

**4. Global Trends Awareness**

## KPIs
- **Population Target**: 100% of citizens above age 10 by 2028.  
- **Accuracy Goal**: ≥80% average across quizzes and identification tasks.  
- **Inclusivity Goal**: Evidence of adoption in rural/low-income districts (tracking uneven adoption).  
- **Engagement Metric**: At least 70% of participants demonstrate awareness of global adoption disparities.

## Tools
- **Online Quizzes**: Multilingual delivery via DIKSHA platform.  
- **Practical Demos**: Deepfake recognition exercises.  
- **Peer Validation**: Community-level awareness checks.  
- **Dashboards**: Tracking adoption by district to address gaps.
