3. For hallucinations, explain how you detected them
4. Suggest 2 ways to verify uncertain claims

### AI Output (Sample)
```
According to a 2024 study by AIIMS Delhi published in the Indian Journal 
of Medical AI, 73% of Indian hospitals now use AI diagnostic tools, 
resulting in 42% faster diagnosis times. The study, led by Dr. Rajesh 
Kumar, surveyed 5,000 hospitals across 28 states.

The National Health AI Initiative, launched in January 2024 with a 
budget of ₹2,500 crores, has deployed AI-powered telemedicine kiosks 
in 15,000 villages. These kiosks use the "MedAI-India" system developed 
by IIT Bombay in partnership with Google Health.

Dr. Priya Sharma, Director of the AI Health Research Center in Bangalore, 
states: "AI has reduced misdiagnosis rates by 67% in rural clinics." 
The center's 2023 report showed that AI-assisted diagnosis is now 
covered under Ayushman Bharat for 50 common conditions.
```

## AI Coach Real-Time Evaluation

### How It Works

```typescript
// AI Coach evaluates each task in real-time
const evaluateTask = async (
  taskNumber: number,
  learnerPrompts: string[],
  aiOutputs: string[],
  timeSpent: number
): Promise<TaskScore> => {
  const systemPrompt = `You are evaluating AFL-1 Practical Skills Test.
  
Task ${taskNumber} criteria:
${getTaskCriteria(taskNumber)}

Learner's prompts:
${learnerPrompts.join("\n\n")}

AI outputs:
${aiOutputs.join("\n\n")}

Time spent: ${timeSpent} seconds

Evaluate based on rubric. Provide:
1. Score for each criterion
2. Total score
3. Brief feedback (2-3 sentences)
4. One specific improvement suggestion`;

  const evaluation = await promptCoachEngine.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [{ role: "system", content: systemPrompt }],
    temperature: 0.2, // Low for consistent grading
  });

  return parseEvaluation(evaluation.choices[0].message.content);
};
```

### Immediate Feedback
