 ## Process
 Teacher admin reporting → auto summaries → parent letters (multilingual).
 
 ## Baseline

 ## CACF Audit
 - Equality 0.97; Bias 0.03; Explainability 0.85; no critical flags.
 
 ## Results
 - Time reduced to 3.8 hrs (−37%); improved clarity/readability.
 
 ## Next Steps
 - Add attendance dashboards and translation QA workflow.
