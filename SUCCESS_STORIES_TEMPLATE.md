**Example Script:**
```
Hi, I'm Rajesh, 18, from Nashik.

Before AFL, I scored 55% in Class 10 and was struggling
with science. I spent 4 hours every day on homework but
still wasn't finishing. I thought about dropping out.

Then I discovered AFL through a village digital literacy camp.
I learned AFL-0 in 1 month, then AFL-1 in 3 months.
I started using ChatGPT for my homework and understood
how to ask the right questions.

After AFL-2, everything changed. I built an AI tool for
exam prep that created personalized study plans.

Results: I scored 82% in Class 12 - that's 27% improvement!
I'm now in government medical college. I saved ₹2 lakh in
coaching fees and trained 50 village students in AI.

If I can learn AI in a village with basic internet, anyone can.
Start with AFL-0. Learn to spot fake news. Then AFL-1 will
change everything. Don't wait. Start today.
```
