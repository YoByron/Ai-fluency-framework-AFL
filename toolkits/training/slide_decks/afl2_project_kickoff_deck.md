Slides:
1) Objectives (workflow integration, CACF, KPIs)
2) Process Mapping (templates) → choose candidate workflows
3) Toolchain Patterns (LLM + data + automation) with examples
4) CACF Audit Plan (equality, bias, explainability, audit-log)
5) KPI Baseline + Dashboard Plan (link: sector dashboard guides)
6) Timeline + Responsibilities (mentor check-ins, peer reviews)
7) Reporting + ROI (link: economic_impact/productivity_calculator.py)
