# Administrator Toolkit – Geographic Benchmarking for AFL Rollouts

## Overview
This toolkit provides administrators with **practical methods for addressing uneven AI adoption**, drawing on insights from the **Anthropic Economic Index 2025** (which highlighted geographic and enterprise-level disparities). The goal is to equip policymakers, district administrators, and education leaders with benchmarking tools to ensure **inclusive AFL rollout across regions**.

---

## Key Challenges
- **Urban-Rural Divide**: High adoption in metros vs. lagging rural districts.  
- **Sector Concentration**: Over-representation of AI in IT/finance vs. underuse in agriculture, health, and MSMEs.  
- **Uneven Resource Allocation**: Districts with strong infrastructure absorb AI faster, leaving others behind.

## Benchmarking Tools

### 1. Regional Adoption Dashboard
- **Metrics**:
  - % of AFL-0 awareness certifications by district.  
  - % of AFL-1 users engaged in daily AI tasks.  
  - Rate of growth in certifications (quarterly).  
- **Source**: Based on DIKSHA and state SCERT integration.  

---

### 2. Inclusion Index
- **Formula**:  
  - % of districts with at least one AFL-0 awareness certification.  
  - % of districts with at least one AFL-1 user engaged in daily AI tasks.  
  - % of districts with at least one certification and at least one user.  
- **Source**: Based on DIKSHA and state SCERT integration.  

---

### 3. Regional Economic Index
- **Formula**:  
  - % of districts with at least one AFL-0 awareness certification.  
  - % of districts with at least one AFL-1 user engaged in daily AI tasks.  
  - % of districts with at least one certification and at least one user.  
  - % of districts with at least one certification and at least one user.  
- Based on DIKSHA and state SCERT integration.  

---

### 4. Regional AI Use Index
- **Formula**:  
  - % of districts with at least one AFL-1 user engaged in daily AI tasks.  
  - % of districts with at least one user.  
- Based on DIKSHA and state SCERT integration.  

---

### 5. Regional AI Adoption Index
- **Formula**:  
  - % of districts with at least one AFL-1 user engaged in daily AI tasks.  
  - % of districts with at least one user.  
  - % of districts with at least one user and at least one certification.  
- Based on DIKSHA and state SCERT integration.  

---

### 6. Regional AI Productivity Index
- **Formula**:  
  - % of districts with at least one AFL-1 user engaged in daily AI tasks.  
  - % of districts with at least one user.  
  - (% of districts with at least one user and at least one certification) x (% of districts with at least one user and at least one certification).  
- Based on DIKSHA and state SCERT integration.  

---

### 7. Regional AI Adoption and Productivity Index
- **Formula**:  
  - % of districts with at least one AFL-1 user engaged in daily AI tasks.  
  - % of districts with at least one user.  
  - % of districts with at least one user and at least one certification.  
  - (% of districts with at least one user and at least one certification) x (% of districts with at least one user and at least one certification).  
- Based on DIKSHA and state SCERT integration.  

---
- **Benchmark**: Target ≥70% parity by 2028.  
- **Use**: Track how well rural districts are catching up with urban peers.  

---

### 8. Sector Readiness Map
- **Indicators**:
- Agri adoption rates (AI for crop advisories).  
- Health usage (AI-assisted diagnostics).  
- MSME AI adoption (automation, decision support).  
- **Action**: Use to identify underrepresented sectors for targeted AFL interventions.  

---

### 9. Adoption Gap Alerts
- **Mechanism**: Automated flagging of districts where adoption <50% of national median.  
- **Action**: Trigger targeted training programs and subsidies.  

---

## Recommended Administrative Actions
1. **Targeted Campaigns**: Run awareness drives in flagged low-adoption districts.  
2. **Subsidy Programs**: Provide free AFL-1 certification access in underserved regions.  
3. **District-Level Competitions**: Encourage cross-district peer benchmarking for adoption metrics.  
4. **Quarterly Reviews**: Use dashboards to track performance against national AFL targets.  

---

## KPIs
- ≥50% reskilling achieved in rural districts by 2030.  
- ≥70% parity on Inclusion Index across districts.  
- Adoption gap narrowed to ≤10% between top and bottom quartile districts.  
- Annual report published on geographic adoption disparities.
