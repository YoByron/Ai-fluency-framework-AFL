 # Program Management Checklist (Admins)

## Before Launch
- Define target cohorts (gender/caste/language/region mix); set equity goals
- Recruit facilitators; schedule training (see training/train-the-trainer.md)
- Prepare venues/connectivity/devices; offline/SMS paths for low-connectivity areas
- Localize materials to state languages; print handouts where needed

## During Delivery
- Track attendance and completions; monitor pass rates and equity splits
- Run proctored assessments (AFL-0 quiz, AFL-1 tasks); assist with portfolios
- Capture before/after KPI snapshots (e.g., time saved) using dashboard guides
 - For AFL-2 projects, run CACF demo checks where applicable:
   - Bash: sh tools/compliance-checker/run_examples.sh
   - PowerShell: tools\compliance-checker\run_examples.ps1

## After Delivery
- Publish district/sector summary; log CACF compliance stats (aggregate)
- Collect facilitator/learner feedback; schedule remediation sessions
- Plan next cohort; expand AFL-2 projects and AFL-3 leaders
