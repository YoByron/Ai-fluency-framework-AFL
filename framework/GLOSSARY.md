When AI generates plausible-sounding but factually incorrect information. AFL-1 teaches detection and mitigation.

### Inference
The process of using a trained AI model to make predictions or generate outputs. Distinguished from training.

### LLM (Large Language Model)
AI models trained on vast text data that can understand and generate human-like text. Examples: GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama.

### Machine Learning (ML)
Subset of AI where systems learn from data rather than following explicit programming.

### Model (AI Model)
A mathematical representation trained on data to perform specific tasks. Models vary in size from millions to trillions of parameters.

### NPU (Neural Processing Unit)
Specialized chip designed for AI/ML operations, increasingly embedded in smartphones. Key enabler for edge AI.

### Open-Source AI
AI models and tools with publicly available code that can be used, modified, and distributed freely. Examples: Llama, Mistral, Kimi K2.

### Parameters
The internal weights in an AI model that are adjusted during training. Model size is often measured in parameters (e.g., 7B = 7 billion).

### Prompt
The input text or instructions given to an AI model. Prompt engineering is a core AFL-1 skill.

### Prompt Engineering
The skill of designing effective prompts to achieve desired AI outputs. Includes techniques like few-shot, chain-of-thought, and system prompts.
