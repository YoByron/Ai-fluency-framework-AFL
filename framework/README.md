# AI Fluency Framework Specifications

This directory contains the core specifications for both the AI Fluency Levels (AFL) framework and the Comprehensive AI Fluency Framework (CAFF), along with integration documentation.

## Framework Overview

The AI Fluency Framework integrates two complementary systems:

### AI Fluency Levels (AFL) - India Implementation
A 6-tier certification system designed for India's context, from foundational awareness to global thought leadership:
- **AFL-0:** AI Awareness
- **AFL-1:** AI Interaction
- **AFL-2:** AI Integration
- **AFL-3:** AI Orchestration
- **AFL-4:** AI Strategy & Leadership
- **AFL-5:** AI Thought Leadership

### Comprehensive AI Fluency Framework (CAFF) - Global Standards
A 6-tier competency framework synthesizing 25+ international frameworks:
- **Tier 1:** AI Awareness and Digital Citizenship
- **Tier 2:** AI Interaction and Practical Application
- **Tier 3:** AI Analysis and Critical Evaluation
- **Tier 4:** AI Innovation and Creative Collaboration
- **Tier 5:** AI Strategy and Organizational Leadership
- **Tier 6:** AI Thought Leadership and Societal Impact

## Quick Start

### For Learners
1. Take the [self-assessment](../toolkits/learners/self-assessment.md) to determine your starting level
2. Review the appropriate AFL level specification
3. Follow the learning pathway for your goals
4. See [curriculum](../curriculum/) for detailed learning materials

### For Trainers
1. Understand all AFL levels in sequence
2. Review the integration matrix to map to global standards
3. Access training materials in [toolkits/trainers](../toolkits/trainers/)
4. Follow certification requirements

### For Organizations
1. Assess organizational needs
2. Map required competencies using the integration matrix
3. Design implementation plan using [implementation guides](../implementation/)
4. Select appropriate pathways for different roles

## Framework Principles

### 1. Progressive Development
Each tier builds on previous levels with clear advancement criteria

### 2. Contextual Adaptation
Core competencies maintain consistency while allowing cultural and contextual customization

### 3. Constitutional Compliance
All levels integrate Constitutional AI Compliance Framework (CACF) safeguards

### 4. Evidence-Based
Grounded in analysis of 25+ existing frameworks and 2025 empirical data

### 5. Implementation-Ready
Detailed specifications enable immediate deployment

## Key Concepts

### Competency Domains
All frameworks address six cross-cutting domains:
1. Technical Understanding
2. Ethical Reasoning
3. Critical Evaluation
4. Collaborative Innovation
5. Adaptive Learning
6. Strategic Leadership

### Assessment Philosophy
- **Knowledge:** Conceptual understanding
- **Skills:** Practical application
- **Application:** Real-world problem-solving
- **Reflection:** Metacognitive awareness

### Certification Standards
- Clear learning outcomes for each level
- Multiple assessment methods
- Validated rubrics and instruments
- Industry-recognized credentials
