# AFL-0: AI Awareness

## Objective
Equip every citizen with a **foundational understanding** of AI — what it is, how it works at a high level, where it’s already present in daily life, and how to engage with it **safely, ethically, and confidently**.

## Core Competencies
By the end of AFL‑0, learners will be able to:
1. **Recognize AI in everyday life** — from search engines to language translation to recommendation systems.
2. **Explain basic AI concepts** in plain language (model, dataset, bias, privacy).
3. **Identify benefits and risks** of AI in personal and community contexts.
4. **Follow basic safety and compliance guidelines** (aligned with CACF principles).
5. **Adopt a growth mindset** towards AI — curiosity over fear.
