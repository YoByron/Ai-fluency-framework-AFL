## Introduction

This document provides the comprehensive competency standards for all six levels of the AI Fluency Levels (AFL) Framework. These standards are designed to:

- **Enable assessment**: Provide clear criteria for evaluating AI fluency at each level
- **Guide curriculum development**: Inform learning objectives and content creation
- **Support credentialing**: Establish standards for certification at each level
- **Enable progression**: Define clear pathways between levels
- **Ensure constitutional compliance**: Integrate CACF requirements at every level

### Design Principles

1. **Competency-Based**: Focus on demonstrable skills, not just knowledge
2. **Context-Sensitive**: Adaptable to various sectors and demographics
3. **Progressive**: Each level builds on prior competencies
4. **Constitutional**: CACF principles embedded throughout
5. **Practical**: Emphasizes real-world application
