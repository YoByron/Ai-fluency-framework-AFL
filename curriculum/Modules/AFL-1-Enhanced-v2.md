**AI Coach Practice:**
```
Learner: "Write about AI"

AI Coach: Too vague! Let's improve it. What's missing?
- WHO is the audience? (Students? Farmers? Policymakers?)
- WHAT aspect of AI? (Benefits? Risks? Applications?)
- HOW LONG? (100 words? 500 words?)
- WHAT TONE? (Technical? Simple? Persuasive?)

Try: "Write a 300-word explanation of AI benefits in agriculture 
for Indian farmers. Use simple Hindi-English mix, include 2 real 
examples, and end with actionable steps."

Success rate: 85% → Your turn to improve!
```

**Practice Scenarios (15):**

```
Task: Create marketing campaign for local handicraft business

AI Coach: Let's chain prompts for better results:

Step 1: Research
"Analyze these 3 competitor websites [URLs]. Identify their 
unique selling points, target audience, and content strategy."

Step 2: Strategy
"Based on this analysis [paste output], create a content 
strategy for a handicraft business selling [product]. Focus 
on [unique aspects]."

Step 3: Content
"Using this strategy [paste], write 5 social media posts 
for Instagram. Each 150 characters, include hashtags, 
culturally relevant for [region]."
