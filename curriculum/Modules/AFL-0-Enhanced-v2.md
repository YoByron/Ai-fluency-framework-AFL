### 4.3 Constitutional AI Compliance Framework (CACF) - Your Rights (60 minutes)
**Learning Goals**: Understand and exercise constitutional rights related to AI

**CRITICAL: This is the foundation of India's approach to AI governance**

**Introduction to CACF (10 minutes)**

**What is CACF?**
- **Constitutional AI Compliance Framework**: India's unique approach to AI governance
- **Purpose**: Ensure AI systems respect constitutional rights
- **Grounding**: Articles 14, 15, 21, 21A of Indian Constitution
- **Scope**: Applies to all AI systems used in India (government and private)
- **Enforcement**: CACF Oversight Board, grievance redress, legal penalties

**Why CACF Matters:**
- India is first country to operationalize constitutional rights through AI governance
- Protects citizens from AI bias, discrimination, privacy violations
- Ensures equitable access to AI benefits

**What it Means for AI:**
- AI must treat all citizens equally
- No discrimination in AI services based on:
  - Caste, religion, gender, language
  - Region, economic status, disability
  - Age, education, occupation
- Equal quality of AI services for all

**Examples:**
- ✅ **Good**: UPI works same for everyone, rich or poor
- ❌ **Bad**: AI loan system denies credit to people from certain castes
- ✅ **Good**: Voice assistant understands all Indian accents equally
- ❌ **Bad**: AI facial recognition less accurate for darker skin tones

**Your Rights:**

**What it Means for AI:**
- AI cannot discriminate on grounds of:
  - Religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth
- Zero tolerance for bias in AI systems
- Proactive measures to prevent discrimination
- Regular bias audits mandatory

**Examples:**
- ✅ **Good**: AI hiring tool evaluates all candidates fairly

**What it Means for AI:**
- AI must protect your privacy
- Your data cannot be used without consent
- You have right to know how AI uses your data
- You can challenge AI decisions affecting your life
- AI systems must be explainable (no black boxes)

**Examples:**
- ✅ **Good**: AI asks permission before collecting your data
- ❌ **Bad**: AI surveillance without your knowledge or consent
- ✅ **Good**: AI explains why it denied your loan application
- ❌ **Bad**: AI makes decisions about you without explanation

**Your Rights:**
- Right to privacy in AI systems
- Right to informed consent for data use
- Right to know how AI makes decisions about you
- Right to challenge AI decisions
- Right to human review of AI decisions

- Undergo bias audit before deployment
- Get CACF compliance certificate

**2. Ongoing Monitoring:**
- Regular bias audits (monthly/quarterly)
- User feedback and complaints tracked
- Performance disparities analyzed
- Compliance reports published

**3. Grievance Redress:**
- Three-tier mechanism (see below)
- Fast resolution (7-14-30 days)
- Free of cost for citizens
- Legal remedies available

**4. Penalties for Violations:**
- **Minor Violations**: ₹10-50 lakh fine
- **Major Violations**: ₹50 lakh - ₹5 crore fine
- **Repeated Violations**: License revocation
- **Grievance Failure**: ₹5-25 lakh per case

**Grievance Redress Mechanism (15 minutes)**

**Three-Tier System:**

**Level 1: Service Provider (7 days)**
- **Who**: Company/organization providing AI service
- **How**: Use app's complaint feature, email, phone
- **Timeline**: 7 days for response
- **Outcome**: Resolution, explanation, or escalation

**Example:**
- You notice AI hiring tool rejected your application unfairly
- Submit complaint through company's grievance portal
- Company investigates, finds bias, corrects decision
- You get fair review of your application

**Level 2: CACF Grievance Portal (14 days)**
- **Who**: National CACF Oversight Board
- **How**: Online portal (cacf.gov.in) or offline (toll-free number, post)
- **Timeline**: 14 days for resolution
- **Outcome**: Investigation, mediation, penalty, or escalation

**Example:**
- Company doesn't respond to your Level 1 complaint
- You file complaint on CACF portal
- CACF investigates, finds company violated CACF
- Company fined, required to fix AI system, compensate you

**Level 3: Legal System (30 days - ongoing)**
- **Who**: Consumer forums, courts, Supreme Court
- **How**: File case with legal representation
- **Timeline**: Varies (30 days - years)
- **Outcome**: Legal judgment, compensation, systemic change

**Example:**
- CACF resolution inadequate, systemic bias continues
- You file case in consumer forum or court
- Court orders comprehensive AI audit, compensation for affected citizens
- Landmark judgment sets precedent for AI governance

**How to File a CACF Grievance:**

**Step 1: Document the Issue**
- Take screenshots, save emails, note dates and times
- Describe: What happened? How were you harmed?
- Evidence: Show how AI violated CACF (discrimination, privacy breach, etc.)

**Step 2: Attempt Level 1 Resolution**
- Contact service provider first
- Give them 7 days to respond
- Document their response (or lack thereof)

**Step 3: File CACF Complaint (if Level 1 fails)**
- Go to cacf.gov.in (or call toll-free 1800-XXX-XXXX)
- Fill complaint form:
  - Your details (name, contact, Aadhaar optional)
  - AI system details (name, company, purpose)
  - CACF violation (which article, how violated)
  - Evidence (upload screenshots, documents)
  - Relief sought (what do you want?)
- Submit and note complaint ID

**Step 4: Track and Follow Up**
- Check status on portal with complaint ID
- Respond to CACF queries within 3 days
- Attend mediation if called
- Accept resolution or escalate to Level 3

**Step 5: Escalate if Needed**
- If CACF resolution inadequate, file legal case
- Seek legal aid if needed (free for economically disadvantaged)
- Persist until justice is served

**Practice Exercise: Filing a CACF Grievance**

**Scenario**: AI-powered loan application system denied your loan without explanation. You suspect bias based on your caste/region.

**Task**:
1. **Document**: What evidence would you collect?
2. **Level 1**: How would you complain to the bank?
3. **Level 2**: If bank doesn't respond, how would you file CACF complaint?
   - Which CACF article was violated? (Article 15: Non-Discrimination, Article 21: Right to Explanation)
   - What relief do you seek? (Loan reconsideration, explanation, bias audit, compensation)
4. **Discuss**: What outcome would be fair?

**Real Case Studies (Examples):**

**Case 1: AI Hiring Bias**
- **Issue**: Tech company's AI rejected qualified SC/ST candidates
- **CACF Violation**: Article 15 (Non-Discrimination)
- **Grievance**: 50+ candidates filed collective complaint
- **Resolution**: Company fined ₹2 crore, AI system audited and fixed, candidates reconsidered
- **Impact**: Company now conducts quarterly bias audits

**Case 2: Privacy Violation**
- **Issue**: Health app shared patient data with insurance companies without consent
- **CACF Violation**: Article 21 (Privacy)
- **Grievance**: Patient filed complaint after insurance premium increased
- **Resolution**: App fined ₹50 lakh, required to delete data, compensate affected users
- **Impact**: Stricter data protection policies implemented

**Case 3: Language Discrimination**
- **Issue**: Government AI service available only in Hindi and English
- **CACF Violation**: Article 14 (Equality), Article 21A (Right to Education)
- **Grievance**: Tamil Nadu citizens filed collective complaint
- **Resolution**: Government ordered to provide service in all 22 languages within 6 months
- **Impact**: Multilingual AI now standard for government services
