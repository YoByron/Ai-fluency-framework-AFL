# Policy Simulation – Viksit Bharat 2047

## Overview
This module integrates **policy simulation capabilities** into the AFL-3 curriculum, linking directly to India’s vision of **Viksit Bharat 2047**. It draws from global evidence (Stanford AI Index, OpenAI/NBER adoption studies, NITI Aayog reports, MIT business insights) to empower orchestrators to design and evaluate AI-driven policy interventions with measurable outcomes.

---

## Objectives
- Enable AFL-3 learners to use AI for **evidence-based policy simulations**.  
- Build fluency in modeling **socio-economic impacts of AI adoption**.  
- Provide tools for policymakers to forecast **productivity, inclusion, and compliance outcomes**.  
- Align simulations with **constitutional principles** and national development goals.  

---

## Competencies
1. **Simulation Design**: Ability to build end-to-end policy models (e.g., education, health, banking, agriculture).  
2. **Data-Driven Forecasting**: Use AI to project sectoral impacts (GDP growth, inclusion metrics).  
3. **Scenario Analysis**: Model multiple policy options and compare trade-offs.  
4. **Constitutional Safeguards**: Ensure simulations align with Articles 14, 15, and 21 (via CACF).  
5. **Stakeholder Communication**: Translate technical simulations into actionable briefs for decision-makers.

## Assessment Rubric
- **Policy Simulation Task**: Build a scenario model (e.g., banking adoption of AI, rural AFL-1 rollout).  
  - **Threshold**: Project ≥15% sectoral productivity gains, validated against benchmarks (NITI 2025).  
- **Scenario Analysis**: Compare 2–3 policy options with quantified trade-offs.  
  - **Threshold**: ≥80% accuracy in forecasting adoption vs. productivity.  
- **Compliance Oversight**: Apply CACF metrics (equality, non-discrimination, privacy).  
  - **Threshold**: 100% compliance demonstration.  
- **Presentation**: Deliver findings in a policy brief format.  

---

## KPIs
- **Impact Accuracy**: ≥80% of AFL-3 learners produce projections within ±10% of benchmarked models.  
- **Sector Penetration**: Simulations cover at least 3 key domains (banking, manufacturing, health, agriculture).  
- **Policy Uptake**: ≥30% of AFL-3 policy briefs adopted by local/state governments.  
- **Compliance Integration**: 100% of simulations include constitutional compliance parameters.  

---

## Tools
- **Digital Twin Simulators**: Virtual models of districts, sectors, and governance systems.  
- **Dashboard Analytics**: Real-time visualization of adoption rates and productivity projections.  
- **Scenario Engines**: AI tools to compare multiple policy pathways.  
- **Brief Generators**: Templates to convert simulations into concise policy memos.  

---

## Outcome
By mastering **policy simulations**, AFL-3 orchestrators can guide India’s transition to **Viksit Bharat 2047** with data-backed, constitutionally compliant, and sector-specific strategies. This transforms abstract AI adoption goals into **concrete, measurable, and actionable policy outcomes**.
