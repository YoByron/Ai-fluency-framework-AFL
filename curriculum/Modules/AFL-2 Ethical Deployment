# Curriculum Module – AFL-2 Ethical Deployment

## Overview
This module strengthens the AFL-2 curriculum with a focus on **ethical deployment of AI**, grounded in insights from the **Stanford AI Index 2025** (responsible AI adoption trends) and **IndiaAI competency framework**. Only ~3.3% of organizations globally have adopted responsible AI practices, highlighting the urgency of embedding **ethics at scale** within AFL training.

---

## Objectives
- Train AFL-2 learners to identify and mitigate **ethical risks** in AI use.  
- Equip learners to apply **bias detection and fairness checks** in workflows.  
- Build capacity for **sectoral case studies** (health, medicine, science, education).  
- Develop AFL-2 validators as **ethical stewards** who support AFL-1 users.  

---

## Competencies
1. **Bias Detection**: Recognizing and addressing algorithmic bias.  
2. **Fairness Validation**: Applying fairness metrics in AI system evaluations.  
3. **Transparency**: Ensuring explainability of AI outputs.  
4. **Ethics-in-Action**: Applying constitutional safeguards (non-discrimination, privacy).  
5. **Sectoral Case Studies**: Learning from AI in medicine/science (responsible deployment).  

---

## Assessment Rubric
- **Bias Case Study**: Identify ≥3 biases in a given AI system and propose mitigation.  
- **Fairness Metric Exercise**: Apply fairness metrics to ≥2 sectoral use cases (e.g., loan approvals, medical diagnosis).  
- **Transparency Audit**: Achieve ≥80% explainability rating in AI output validation tasks.  
- **Ethics Application**: Demonstrate compliance with Articles 14 & 21 of the Constitution in simulated deployments.  

---

## KPIs
- ≥80% accuracy in bias identification tasks.  
- ≥70% improvement in fairness scores across validated systems.  
- 100% application of transparency audits in assessments.  
- 100% compliance with CACF ethical benchmarks.  

---

## Tools
- **Bias Detection Sandbox**: Hands-on simulations with biased datasets.  
- **Fairness Metrics Library**: Templates for quantitative fairness testing.  
- **Transparency Dashboard**: AI explainability visualizations.  
- **Ethics Case Repository**: Real-world cases (AI in medicine, science, education).  

---

## Outcome
Ethical deployment at AFL-2 ensures that **validators act as the guardians of trust** in AI systems. By embedding fairness, transparency, and constitutional safeguards, AFL-2 learners create a foundation for **scalable and responsible orchestration at AFL-3**.
