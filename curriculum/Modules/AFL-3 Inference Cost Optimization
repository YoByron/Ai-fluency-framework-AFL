# Curriculum Module – AFL-3 Inference Cost Optimization

## Overview
This module enhances the AFL-3 curriculum by embedding **inference cost optimization** skills, building on insights from the **Stanford AI Index 2025**, which tracks trends in AI hardware, inference costs, and efficiency benchmarks. Orchestrators must ensure that AI deployments are not only impactful but also **cost-efficient and scalable** for sustainable adoption.

---

## Objectives
- Train orchestrators to evaluate and optimize **AI inference costs**.  
- Integrate efficiency metrics into **deployment workflows**.  
- Align optimization practices with **sectoral needs** (banking, manufacturing, healthcare).  
- Ensure cost-effectiveness without compromising **accuracy, fairness, or compliance**.  

---

## Competencies
1. **Inference Benchmarking**: Measure performance across models and platforms.  
2. **Efficiency Engineering**: Apply model compression, quantization, and distillation.  
3. **Cost-Performance Trade-offs**: Balance accuracy vs. compute expenditure.  
4. **Scalable Deployment**: Optimize inference for large-scale rollouts (e.g., district/state level).  
5. **Compliance Alignment**: Ensure optimization practices maintain CACF safeguards.

- ≥90% model accuracy maintained post-optimization.  
- ≥70% of AFL-3 orchestrators demonstrate cost-performance balancing in projects.  
- 100% optimization workflows documented with compliance validation.  

---

## Tools
- **Benchmarking Dashboards**: Real-time comparison of inference costs across models.  
- **Optimization Libraries**: Pre-built scripts for quantization, pruning, distillation.  
- **Scenario Simulators**: Tools to test cost vs. accuracy trade-offs.  
- **Compliance Checklists**: Ensure optimization aligns with CACF and sectoral regulations.
