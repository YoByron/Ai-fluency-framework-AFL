# Curriculum Module – AFL-2 Decision Support

## Overview
This module strengthens the AFL-2 curriculum by focusing on **decision support**, integrating evidence from the **OpenAI/NBER 2025 study** on ChatGPT usage. Findings showed that over **80% of work-related AI interactions** center on writing, information-seeking, and practical guidance, confirming decision support as a **core productivity lever**.

---

## Objectives
- Enable AFL-2 learners to use AI for **evidence-based decision-making**.  
- Build fluency in **validating AI-provided guidance** against trusted sources.  
- Train learners to design **decision-support workflows** in public and private sectors.  
- Develop competencies to **teach and support AFL-1 users** in everyday decision-making tasks.  

---

## Competencies
1. **Information Validation**: Ability to cross-check AI recommendations with reliable data.  
2. **Bias Awareness**: Identifying subtle bias in AI-generated suggestions.  
3. **Scenario Analysis**: Using AI to generate and compare multiple options.  
4. **Domain Application**: Applying decision support in sectoral contexts (healthcare, agriculture, banking, education).  
5. **Peer Training**: Teaching AFL-1 users how to responsibly use AI for small decisions.  

---

## Assessment Rubric
- **Validation Exercise**: Given 10 AI-generated recommendations, validate ≥8 correctly against trusted references.  
- **Bias Check**: Identify bias in ≥4/5 AI-generated decision scenarios.  
- **Workflow Task**: Build one decision-support workflow that improves accuracy or efficiency by ≥20%.  
- **Peer Training Evidence**: Document training of ≥5 AFL-1 users in decision-support practices.  

---

## KPIs
- **Accuracy Goal**: ≥80% correct validation of AI-based decisions.  
- **Productivity Benchmark**: ≥20% efficiency gains in decision workflows.  
- **Training Impact**: 1 AFL-2 validator trains at least 5 AFL-1 users in decision-support.  
- **Sector Penetration**: ≥50% of AFL-2 learners demonstrate decision-support use cases in high-impact sectors.  

---

## Tools
- **Scenario Simulations**: AI-assisted decision-support in sandbox environments.  
- **Bias Detection Modules**: Case studies of decision bias and mitigation techniques.  
- **Portfolio Documentation**: Real-world examples of AI-aided decisions logged by learners.  
- **Peer Validation**: AFL-3 orchestrators review AFL-2 decision-support portfolios.  

---

## Outcome
Decision support at AFL-2 equips learners to become **trusted validators of AI-driven guidance**. They ensure that AI is not blindly followed but **critically assessed, contextually applied, and ethically grounded**—laying the foundation for orchestrators (AFL-3) to scale decision-support across institutions.
