# Curriculum Module – AFL-1 Non-Work Applications

## Overview
This module expands the AFL-1 curriculum by integrating insights from the **OpenAI/NBER 2025 study**, which found that over **70% of global AI use occurs outside of formal work settings**. Non-work adoption drives familiarity, comfort, and inclusivity, making it a critical lever for mass fluency at AFL-1.
