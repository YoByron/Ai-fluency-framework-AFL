# Curriculum Module – AFL-0 Global Awareness & Adoption

## Overview
This module enhances the AFL-0 curriculum by integrating global AI adoption trends from the **Stanford AI Index 2025** and **Anthropic Economic Index 2025**. AFL-0 learners, as **AI Aware individuals**, must develop a baseline understanding of **global diffusion patterns, disparities, and ethical considerations** before progressing to higher levels.

---

## Objectives
- Build awareness of **global AI adoption rates** and disparities.  
- Introduce learners to **basic ethical and societal implications** of AI.  
- Encourage curiosity and critical reflection on AI’s role in daily life.  
- Prepare learners to engage responsibly with AFL-1 training.  

---

## Competencies
1. **Global Trends Recognition**: Understand AI usage patterns worldwide (e.g., 10% adult adoption globally, OpenAI/NBER 2025).  
2. **Adoption Disparities**: Awareness of uneven AI access across regions, industries, and demographics (Anthropic 2025).  
3. **Ethical Curiosity**: Ability to identify simple ethical risks (privacy, misinformation, bias).  
4. **Media Literacy**: Detecting and questioning deepfakes or misleading AI content.  
5. **Civic Awareness**: Recognizing AI’s potential in education, healthcare, and governance.

## Assessment Rubric
- **Trend Identification**: Learner identifies ≥3 global AI adoption statistics.  
- **Disparity Awareness Task**: Learner explains ≥2 examples of uneven adoption (urban vs. rural, enterprise vs. individual).  
- **Ethics Quiz**: Learner scores ≥70% on a basic ethics and awareness quiz.  
- **Deepfake Exercise**: Learner correctly identifies ≥2/3 AI-generated fake media samples.  

---

## KPIs
- ≥80% of AFL-0 learners can articulate at least 3 global adoption facts.  
- ≥70% demonstrate understanding of adoption disparities.  
- ≥75% accuracy in ethics awareness tasks.  
- ≥80% accuracy in deepfake/media literacy exercises.  

---

## Tools
- **Global Adoption Infographics**: Visuals showing AI usage by country and sector.  
- **Disparity Dashboards**: Simple maps comparing rural vs. urban adoption.  
- **Ethics Quick Guide**: Short primers on privacy, fairness, and misinformation.  
- **Deepfake Demos**: Controlled examples for awareness-building exercises.  

---

## Outcome
By integrating **global awareness and adoption disparities** at AFL-0, learners develop the **foundational curiosity and critical thinking** necessary for responsible engagement with AI. This ensures that fluency begins with **awareness, inclusivity, and ethics** at the earliest stage.
