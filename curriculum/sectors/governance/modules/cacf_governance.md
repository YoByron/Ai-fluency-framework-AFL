 # Module: CACF Governance (Governance)
 
 Outcomes: institutionalize CACF via policy, audit cadence, grievance workflows, and procurement gates.
 
 Activities:
 - Draft a departmental CACF policy (Articles 14/15/21/21A mapping).
 - Define API integration points (check/bias/explain/audit-log) and thresholds.
 - Set monthly/quarterly audit schedule; publish aggregate stats.
 - Configure grievance escalation (provider → CACF portal → forums/courts).
 
 Assessment: policy document, audit plan, and evidence of API checks (no critical flags).
