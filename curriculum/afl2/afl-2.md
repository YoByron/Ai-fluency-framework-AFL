# AFL-2 Curriculum: AI Integration (Process Innovators)

## Objective
Enable practitioners to design and integrate AI into real workflows, delivering measured productivity gains while embedding CACF compliance.

## Target Audience
- Team leads, managers, operations and domain experts
- Trainers/facilitators upgrading from AFL-1
- Government functionaries integrating AI into services

## Duration
40–60 hours (blended: workshops, labs, mentored projects)

## Core Competencies
1. Workflow analysis and AI opportunity identification
2. Multi-tool integration and process optimization
3. Bias detection and CACF compliance implementation
4. Impact measurement and reporting
5. Train-the-trainer fundamentals (for AFL-0/1 rollout)

## Module Breakdown
- Module 1: Process Mapping & Opportunity Discovery (8–10h)
- Module 2: Toolchain Integration & Automation (10–12h)
- Module 3: CACF in Practice (Bias, Privacy, Audit) (8–10h)
- Module 4: Measurement & Change Management (6–8h)
- Module 5: Train-the-Trainer Essentials (6–8h)

## Learning Activities
- Map one real workflow; identify augment vs automate steps
- Build a multi-tool pipeline (e.g., LLM + spreadsheet + RPA)
- Run a bias audit on sample outputs; document mitigations
- Define KPIs; set up a simple dashboard for before/after
- Deliver a mini-session teaching AFL-0/1 concepts

## Assessment
- Project: Implement an AI-enhanced workflow with ≥20% efficiency gain
- Compliance: Submit CACF audit (bias, equality, explainability) with no critical flags
- Report: Metrics, lessons learned, mitigation log
- Peer Review: Cross-evaluate projects for robustness

## Resources
- Workflow templates and KPI catalog
- CACF audit checklist and example payloads
- Integration examples (sheets, forms, RPA, APIs)

## Certification
Digital badge: “AI Integration (AFL-2)” — valid 3 years; recertify via project refresh or audit update

## Implementation Notes
- Prefer augment-first designs; automate only stable sub-steps
- Localize tool choices per context; avoid vendor lock-in
- Maintain an audit trail for all changes and outputs
