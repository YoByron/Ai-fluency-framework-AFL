# AFL‑1 Curriculum: AI Interaction

## Objective
Enable learners to **confidently and effectively interact with AI systems** to accomplish personal, educational, and professional tasks — while applying ethical and compliance safeguards.

---

## Target Audience
- Knowledge workers
- Educators and trainers
- Small and medium enterprise (SME) owners
- Students in higher education
- Public service staff

---

## Duration
**12–16 hours** total learning time  
(Delivered as 6–8 modules, online or blended)

---

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of AFL‑1, learners will be able to:
1. **Craft effective prompts** for different contexts and goals.
2. **Conduct multi‑turn dialogues** to refine AI outputs.
3. **Incorporate domain and cultural context** into AI interactions.
4. **Evaluate AI outputs** for accuracy, bias, and compliance.
5. **Apply CACF principles** in everyday AI use.

- Disclosure of AI use in work products
- Handling sensitive data

---

## Learning Activities
- **Prompt lab**: Learners test and compare prompt variations.
- **Refinement challenge**: Start with a vague prompt, improve it in 3 iterations.
- **Bias hunt**: Identify and correct bias in AI outputs.
- **Compliance role‑play**: Simulate AI use in a regulated environment.

---

## Assessment
- **Practical tasks**: Submit AI‑generated work with prompt history.
- **Peer review**: Evaluate each other’s prompts and outputs.
- **Compliance checklist**: Apply CACF to a sample AI task.

---

## Resources
- Prompt engineering cheat sheet
- Case studies of effective AI use in different sectors
- CACF quick‑reference guide
- Access to sandbox AI tools for practice

---

## Certification
- **Digital badge**: “AI Interaction Certified” — valid for 3 years
- Badge metadata includes:
  - Completion date
  - Issuing authority
  - Skills acquired

---

## Implementation Notes
- Encourage **cross‑domain practice** — e.g., an educator tries business prompts, a business owner tries educational prompts.
- Integrate **real‑world tasks** from learners’ own work or study.
- Use **before/after comparisons** to measure productivity gains.
