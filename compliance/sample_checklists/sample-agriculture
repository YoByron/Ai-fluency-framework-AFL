# CACF Compliance Checklist – Sample (Agriculture AI Advisory System)

## Purpose
This sample demonstrates CACF compliance for an **AI-based agriculture advisory system** that provides farmers with crop recommendations, weather alerts, and yield predictions. Agriculture systems must prioritize **linguistic justice, inclusion, and non-discrimination**, since the majority of users are rural smallholders.
