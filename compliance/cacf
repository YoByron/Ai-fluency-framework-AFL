# Constitutional AI Compliance Framework (CACF) — Updated Version

## Purpose & Scope  
CACF defines the constitutional, ethical, and technical guardrails for AI deployment in India. This updated version integrates research protocols (federated learning, emergency overrides, bias mitigation), IndiaAI competency alignment, and sectoral compliance mechanisms. All AI systems used in public, semi-public, or mission-critical contexts must adhere to CACF before deployment.

## Constitutional Anchors & Metrics

| Principle / Right        | Constitutional Basis     | Key Metric / Indicator           | Enforcement Mechanism                   | Threshold / Target      |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Equality**             | Article 14                | Demographic parity analysis        | Suspend or block system with >5% variance  | ≥95% parity              |
| **Non-Discrimination**   | Article 15                | Automated bias detection across protected groups | Contract termination + penalties       | >95% neutrality          |
| **Life & Dignity**        | Article 21                 | Dignity impact assessment         | Legal liability for outputs injurious to dignity | 100% compliance     |
| **Linguistic Justice**   | Arts. 343–351              | Support for 22 official languages  | Procurement ban if language coverage incomplete | Full coverage         |
| **Transparency**         | RTI, Article 19(1)(a)     | Explainability index for decisions | Public audit & appeal rights               | ≥80% explainable         |
| **Privacy & Data Protection** | Article 21 (expanded)    | Data protection, retention, consent | GDPR-level penalties + rapid grievance redressal | Zero violations tolerated |

## IndiaAI Competency Integration

CACF embeds IndiaAI’s competency dimensions:

- **Behavioral (Ethics, Curiosity, Adaptability)**  
  → Required across all AFL levels. Validators and orchestrators must document ethical reasoning.  

- **Functional (Procurement, Governance, Compliance)**  
  → Compliance checks embedded in government procurement contracts and system design.  

- **Domain-Specific (Health, Education, Agriculture, Finance)**  
  → Sector templates and domain-specific compliance addenda integrated into CACF.

## Research Protocols & Safeguards

### 1. Federated Learning as a Sovereignty Mechanism  
Sensitive data (e.g. health, finance) must remain local; only model weights or gradients may be shared.  

### 2. Bias Mitigation & Audits  
Continuous bias audits must run with fairness metrics. Tolerance threshold: ≤5% demographic deviation across protected classes.  

### 3. Emergency Override / Kill-Switch Protocols  
Critical AI systems (infrastructure, healthcare, security) must include fail-safe or kill switches, with alerts to district administrators and NITI Aayog / CACF oversight.  

### 4. Blockchain-based Traceability & Verification  
All AI decisions should log an immutable record. AFL certifications and decision logs should carry verifiable credentials.  

### 5. Constitutional Alignment Layers  
Use model alignment techniques (e.g. constitutional decoding, constrained generation) to ensure outputs respect Articles 14, 15, 19, 21, etc. (See e.g. *C3AI: Crafting Constitutions for Constitutional AI*) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Tools, Dashboards & Mechanisms

- **Real-time Compliance APIs**: Validate decision outputs against CACF in pipeline.  
- **Public Audit Dashboards**: Show compliance scores by department/region.  
- **RTI-based Grievance System**: Allow citizens to challenge AI decisions.  
- **Certification Gate**: No AI system may be procured or scaled without CACF clearance.  

---

## Oversight, Accountability & Governance

- **Oversight Body**: NITI Aayog + independent CACF compliance commission.  
- **Audit Cadence**: Quarterly audits for all AI systems handling critical / public data.  
- **Escalation**: Violations escalated to Parliament-level committee within 60 days.  
- **International Benchmarking**: Annual review versus OECD / EU AI governance frameworks.

---

## KPIs & Targets

- ≥95% of government AI systems meet equality & non-discrimination metrics.  
- 100% of AFL-3/4/5 orchestrators trained in CACF compliance.  
- Public compliance dashboards updated quarterly.  
- All privacy violations resolved within 30 days.  
- ≥70% adoption of federated learning in sensitive sectors by 2030.

## Integration with AFL Levels

Each AFL level (0–5) must incorporate CACF check references:

- **AFL0–1**: Basic awareness of rights, transparency, privacy.  
- **AFL2**: Validator training in bias detection and constitutional reasoning.  
- **AFL3–4**: Orchestration workflows constrained by CACF layers and override protocols.  
- **AFL5**: Research-level compliance, innovation within constitutional boundaries.

- **Last Updated**: [Date27/09/2025]  
- **Next Review**: Annually or after major constitutional / legal shifts.
