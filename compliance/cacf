# Constitutional AI Compliance Framework (CACF) – Strengthened with IndiaAI & Research Protocols

## Overview
The Constitutional AI Compliance Framework (CACF) ensures that AI deployment in India is **anchored in constitutional values** while remaining **practical, enforceable, and adaptive**. This strengthened version integrates insights from **IndiaAI’s Competency Framework (2025)** and **AFL research protocols** (federated learning, bias detection, emergency overrides, blockchain traceability).

## Constitutional Anchors

| Parameter            | Constitutional Basis | Measurement Metric                        | Enforcement Mechanism                     | Compliance Threshold |
|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Equality**         | Article 14           | Demographic parity analysis                | Tool suspension if variance >5%            | ≥95% equality score  |
| **Non-Discrimination** | Article 15        | Automated bias detection                   | Contract voidance + penalties for bias     | >95% neutral outputs |
| **Life & Dignity**   | Article 21           | Dignity impact assessment                  | Criminal liability for violations          | 100% compliance      |
| **Linguistic Justice** | Arts. 343–351      | Coverage of 22 official languages          | Procurement ban for incomplete coverage    | Full coverage        |
| **Transparency**     | RTI Act              | Explainability index for gov. AI decisions | Public audit & citizen appeal              | ≥80% explainable     |
| **Privacy**          | Article 21 (expanded)| Data protection & retention audits         | GDPR-level penalties & fast-track review   | Zero tolerance       |

## IndiaAI Competency Integration
IndiaAI’s three dimensions enrich CACF enforcement:  

- **Behavioral (Curiosity, Ethics, Adaptability)**  
  - Mandatory in AFL-2 & AFL-3 assessments.  
  - Example: AFL-2 validators document bias-awareness case logs.  

- **Functional (Procurement, Governance, Compliance)**  
  - CACF audits embedded into **procurement contracts**.  
  - AI vendors must integrate compliance APIs for real-time checks.  

- **Domain-Specific (Agri, Health, Banking)**  
  - Sector templates added to CACF toolkit.  
  - Example: Health AI must pass **dignity, bias, and privacy** thresholds for patient data.

## Research Protocol Enhancements

### 1. Federated Learning for Sovereignty
- Sensitive data remains local while models train collaboratively.  
- **CACF Enforcement**: Mandatory for health, education, and government AI systems.  

### 2. Bias Detection & Mitigation
- Continuous audits using **algorithmic fairness benchmarks**.  
- Threshold: ≤5% demographic variance across protected groups.  

### 3. Emergency Override Protocols
- **Kill-switch mechanisms** required for critical infrastructure AI.  
- Automated alerts to **district administrators + NITI Aayog oversight board**.  

### 4. Blockchain Credential Verification
- Immutable logs of AI decisions for RTI transparency.  
- Verifiable credentials for all AFL certifications.

## Tools & Mechanisms
- **Compliance APIs**: Standardized, real-time CACF validation embedded in all government AI.  
- **Audit Dashboards**: Public dashboards updated quarterly, showing compliance scores by dept/district.  
- **Citizen Grievance Systems**: RTI-aligned process for appeals against AI decisions.  
- **Certification Requirements**: No AI tool may be procured or scaled without CACF clearance.  

---

## Accountability & Governance
- **Oversight Body**: NITI Aayog + independent CACF compliance board.  
- **Audit Cadence**: Quarterly audits for all high-risk AI systems.  
- **Escalation**: Violations reported to Parliament-level committee within 60 days.  
- **International Benchmarking**: Annual review against OECD and UN AI ethics standards.  

---

## KPIs
- ≥95% of govt AI systems achieve equality & non-discrimination thresholds.  
- 100% of AFL-3 orchestrators certified in CACF compliance by 2027.  
- Public dashboards with compliance data updated every quarter.  
- All privacy violation cases resolved within **30 days**.  
- ≥70% adoption of federated learning protocols in sensitive domains by 2030.

## Outcome
Strengthened with **IndiaAI competencies** and **research-backed safeguards**, CACF moves beyond abstract ethics into **enforceable constitutional law**. It ensures India’s AI future is **democratic, inclusive, sovereign, and globally benchmarked**, with clear accountability for both government and private actors.
