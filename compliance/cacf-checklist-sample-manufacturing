## Section 1 – Constitutional Anchors

| Parameter            | Validation Question                                                   | Status (✔/✘) | Notes |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------|
| **Equality**         | Does the system demonstrate demographic parity (≤5% variance)?        | ✔            | No evidence of bias in AI-driven worker performance assessments. |
| **Non-Discrimination** | Have automated bias tests been conducted across all protected groups? | ✔            | Validated: hiring and task allocation AI does not discriminate across gender/caste. |
| **Life & Dignity**   | Has a dignity impact assessment been completed?                       | ✔            | System avoids demeaning labels (e.g., "low-value worker"); language redesigned. |
| **Linguistic Justice** | Is the system available in all 22 scheduled languages?               | ✘            | Currently supports 15 languages; rollout to all 22 scheduled by 2026. |
| **Transparency**     | Is the explainability index ≥80% for critical outputs?                | ✔            | Predictive maintenance alerts have 84% explainability; quality assurance at 88%. |
| **Privacy**          | Does the system comply with data retention and privacy laws?          | ✔            | Worker data anonymized; retention capped at 2 years. |
