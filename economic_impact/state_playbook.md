 # State Economic Impact Playbook

Use this to produce credible, comparable state-level estimates and dashboards.

## Steps
1) Baseline data: employees by department/sector, average wages, hours per task; MSME counts; farmer cohorts
2) Program plan: AFL-0/1/2 targets; facilitator network; vernacular delivery plan
3) Map workflows: 3–5 per sector with clear KPIs (time saved, quality, revenue)
4) Run calculator with state-adjusted shares/adoption; then Monte Carlo for sensitivity
5) Publish a quarterly dashboard: completions, equity splits, KPI deltas, CACF aggregates

## Templates
- Use toolkits/shared_resources/templates/*.csv for rosters, schedules, attendance
- Sector dashboard guides under curriculum/sectors/*/modules/dashboard_guide.md

## Reporting
- Methods appendix linking to methodology.md and calculator flags
- Highlight p10/median/p90 ranges; avoid single-point claims
- Document mitigations for any CACF flags (aggregate only)
