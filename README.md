# AI Fluency Framework (AFL)

**Building India's Premier AI Fluency Framework for Viksit Bharat 2047**

A comprehensive **curriculum and assessment framework** that transforms citizens into AI-empowered professionals through 6 competency levels (AFL 0-5), with Constitutional AI Compliance (CACF) safeguards built into the curriculum design.

> **What This Is:** A comprehensive AI literacy framework with detailed curricula, assessments, rubrics, and policy guides for educational institutions and organizations.
>
> **What This Isn't:** A software platform or deployable application (see [AUDIT_REPORT.md](AFL_FRAMEWORK_AUDIT_REPORT.md) for details).

## 🎯 Vision

**500M AI-fluent citizens by 2047** across all walks of life - from rural students to urban professionals, farmers to scientists, teachers to policymakers.

**Why This Matters:**
- India's demographic dividend (65% under 35) meets the AI revolution
- 95% of Indians lack AI literacy - massive opportunity
- Standardized framework enables rapid scaling across 1.4B people
- Economic impact: ₹50,000+ crores annual productivity gains

## 🔥 The AFL Framework Difference

### **6-Level Competency Framework**
From digital literacy to global thought leadership:

- **AFL-0**: Digital Literacy (recognize deepfakes, use UPI safely, spot AI in daily life)
- **AFL-1**: Prompt Engineering (master ChatGPT, save 10 hours/week, boost productivity 50%)
- **AFL-2**: Integration (automate workflows, reduce defects 90%, save ₹50 lakh/year)
- **AFL-3**: Orchestration (coordinate 500+ people, lead AI adoption, manage multi-stakeholder projects)
- **AFL-4**: Strategic Leadership (transform organizations, design policy, influence 10,000+ people)
- **AFL-5**: Thought Leadership (create global frameworks, pioneer AI research, shape international standards)

### **Real Impact for Real People**

**Rajesh, Rural Student (16):** Uses AI for exam prep, scores 20% higher, saves 10 hours/week
**Priya, Marketing Pro (28):** Automates content creation, gets 40% productivity boost, ₹5 lakh raise
