# AI Fluency Framework (AFL): Operational Blueprint

Purpose:
This repository converts "AI Fluency, Not AI Factories" into an operational, version-controlled program for rolling out AFL certifications (AFL-0 → AFL-3) and the Constitutional AI Compliance Framework (CACF). It contains curriculum, implementation playbooks, compliance tooling patterns, economic impact calculators, and pilot tracking templates.

Quick start:
1. Read docs/research_foundation.md for the evidence base and core metrics.
2. Use docs/rollout_timeline.md to choose your phase and branch.
3. Review docs/appendix_curricula.md for curricula and assessments.
4. Use cacf_compliance/implementation_guide.md to instrument constitutional compliance.
5. Run economic_impact/productivity_calculator.py to reproduce ROI and sector projections.

Primary directories:
- docs/ — research summary, timeline, contributor guide
- afl0_baseline_literacy/ — learning modules & assessment assets
- afl1_applied_literacy/ — prompt libraries, multilingual assets
- afl2_validator_training/ — bias tests, validator toolkits, capstones
- afl3_orchestrator_workflows/ — orchestrator templates, agent blueprints
- cacf_compliance/ — checklists, APIs, monitoring patterns
- economic_impact/ — calculators, time-motion templates
- risk_management/ — mitigation playbooks
- intl_cooperation/ — bilateral & multilateral proposal templates

Contributing:
- Follow docs/CONTRIBUTING.md (standards for curriculum changes, legal/copyright notices for datasets, privacy-preserving guidelines).
- Each curriculum change must include: learning objectives, time estimate, assessment rubrics, and references to paper sections.

Issue triage:
- Tag issues with "curriculum", "compliance", "pilot", "infrastructure", or "research".
- All PRs touching CACF must include an automated test or simulation demonstrating the compliance metric change.
