# Updated Statistics for AI Fluency Framework - September 26, 2025

This document compiles fresh data to update v6.0 of the research paper. Sources include TRAI, McKinsey, Stanford AI Index, WEF Future of Jobs, and NITI Aayog reports (queried Sep 2025). Use this to refresh sections like 1.2 "Current State Assessment" (e.g., replace 850M internet users with 1,002M+).

## Internet and Digital Access (Replace old IAMAI 2023 stats)
- Total internet subscribers: 1,002.85 million (April-June 2025, TRAI). Wireless broadband: ~1,171M (July 2025).
- Penetration rate: ~55.9% (Statista Jul 2025; up from 38% in v6.0).
- Smartphone users: Implied ~650-700M+ (cross-referenced with 52-55% penetration; WEF notes high digital public infra like UPI/Aadhaar).
- Rural/Urban divide: Rural subscribers declining slightly (TRAI Jul 2025), highlighting digital divide risks for AFL rollout.

## AI Adoption in India (Update global discourse sections)
- Company implementation: 59% of Indian companies have deployed AI (McKinsey State of AI 2025; global leader, up from 27% scaled beyond pilots).
- Per-capita usage: India at 0.27x global average (Anthropic Economic Index Sep 2025), but non-work usage >73% (OpenAI Sep 2025 study).
- Investments: $1.25B pledged by stakeholders (Stanford AI Index 2025; India ranks 10th globally, 2nd in AI GitHub projects).
- Economic impact: AI could add $600B to GDP by 2035 (NITI Aayog Sep 2025 report).

## Reskilling and Human Capital (Update AFL targets and risks)
- Workforce needs: 50% of global workers require AI reskilling by 2027 (WEF Future of Jobs 2025; in India, 2/3 firms tapping diverse pools for tech roles).
- Job disruption: 22% of jobs disrupted by 2030 (170M created, 92M displaced; net +78M). India focuses on upskilling via Skill India partnerships.
- Productivity gains: Organizations with high AI adoption see 6-10% revenue increases (McKinsey 2025; validates v6.0's 10-20% projection).
