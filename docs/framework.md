# AI Fluency Framework (AFL)

## Purpose
The AI Fluency Framework (AFL) defines the **progressive competencies** required for individuals, organizations, and governments to use AI effectively, ethically, and at scale.  
It is designed to:
- **Democratize AI capability** across all sectors.
- **Embed Constitutional AI Compliance (CACF)** into every interaction.
- **Bridge the capability–utilization gap** by focusing on adoption, not just model development.

## AFL Levels Overview

| Level  | Name | Target Audience | Core Competencies | Outcomes |
|--------|------|-----------------|-------------------|----------|
| **AFL‑0** | AI Awareness | General public, students, entry‑level workforce | Basic AI concepts, benefits & risks, everyday use cases | Informed citizens who can engage with AI safely |
| **AFL‑1** | AI Interaction | Knowledge workers, educators, SMEs | Effective prompting, multi‑turn dialogue, context‑aware use | Productive, ethical AI use in daily tasks |
| **AFL‑2** | AI Integration | Managers, policy teams, domain experts | Workflow integration, tool selection, compliance checks | AI embedded into processes with measurable gains |
| **AFL‑3** | AI Leadership | Executives, policymakers, system architects | Strategic AI deployment, governance, scaling, innovation | AI‑driven transformation at organizational/national scale |
