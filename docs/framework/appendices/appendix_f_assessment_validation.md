 # Appendix F: Assessment Validation (Psychometrics) – CAFF v1.1

Objective: Establish reliable, valid, and fair assessment across tiers and domains.

- Constructs: map each rubric criterion to latent factors (e.g., Prompting, Critical Evaluation, Ethics, Governance).
- Evidence plan
  - Content validity: SME mapping matrix, CVR/CVI targets; blueprint coverage ≥ 0.9
  - Reliability: alpha/omega by subscale ≥ .75; inter‑rater ICC ≥ .70 for performance tasks
  - Structure: EFA→CFA; fit (CFI/TLI ≥ .90, RMSEA ≤ .08)
  - Convergent/divergent: AVE ≥ .50; correlations align with theory
  - Criterion: correlation with external outcomes (course success, workplace KPIs)
  - Fairness: DIF analysis across gender, language, SES; adverse impact checks
- Scoring & standard setting: Angoff or Bookmark; cut‑scores per tier with error bands; report SE of measurement.
- Rater training: anchor guides, calibration sessions, drift monitoring.
- Operations: versioning, item bank rotation, audit logs, incident response for compromised items.
- Reporting: learner + program dashboards; effect sizes; actionable feedback.
