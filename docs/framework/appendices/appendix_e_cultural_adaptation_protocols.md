 # Appendix E: Cultural Adaptation Protocols (CAFF v1.1)

Purpose: Ensure fair, culturally relevant implementation across languages, regions, and communities while preserving core competencies and comparability.

- Localization scope: language, idioms/examples, tool access constraints, cultural norms, indigenous knowledge.
- Guardrails: never change assessed construct; document all adaptations; run small-sample cognitive labs before rollout.
- Process
  1) Context scan: learner profile, tech access, privacy laws, cultural sensitivities
  2) Translate + transcreate: bilingual SME pass; back‑translation spot checks
  3) Cognitive interviews (n=8–12): comprehension, difficulty, offensiveness, relevance
  4) Pilot (n≥100): item stats, DIF screening, reliability targets
  5) Calibrate + document: version IDs, change log, evidence memo
- Validation targets: alpha/omega ≥ .75 per subscale; RMSEA ≤ .08 (CFA); invariant loadings across key groups when feasible.
- Assessment fairness: measure DIF (Mantel–Haenszel/logistic), remove items with large uniform DIF unless construct‑relevant.
- Versioning: semantic versioning per locale (e.g., afl2_assess_hi-IN@1.2.0).
- Documentation: adaptation report, sampling, psychometrics, open issues, next review window.
