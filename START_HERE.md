# START HERE: An Introduction to the AI Fluency Framework

Welcome to the AI Fluency Framework (AFL), a comprehensive, open-source initiative to build mass AI fluency for India and the world.

## The Vision

Our core thesis is that in the age of AI, the primary competitive advantage lies not in possessing the most powerful models, but in cultivating the most fluent and capable human users. This repository contains the blueprint for that mission.

We aim to democratize AI competence, shift the focus from model supremacy to human-AI symbiosis, and operationalize a unique **Constitutional AI Compliance Framework (CACF)** that embeds democratic values into every AI interaction.

To understand the full vision, please read:

## How It Works: The Canonical Reading List

This project is large, but it is built on a few core, canonical documents. To understand the framework, please read them in the following order:

1.  **[The Framework Specifications](framework/README.md)**: This provides a high-level overview of the dual AFL (India-specific) and CAFF (global) competency frameworks.

2.  **The Curricula**: These documents are the pedagogical heart of the project, detailing the learning objectives for each level of AI Fluency.
    - [AFL-0: AI Awareness](curriculum/afl0/afl-0.md)
    - [AFL-1: AI Interaction](curriculum/afl1/afl-1.md)
    - [AFL-2: AI Integration](curriculum/afl2/afl-2.md)
    - [AFL-3: AI Orchestration](curriculum/afl3/afl-3.md)
    - [AFL-4: AI Strategy & Leadership](curriculum/afl4/afl-4.md)
    - [AFL-5: AI Thought Leadership](curriculum/afl5/afl-5.md)

3.  **The Constitutional AI Compliance Framework (CACF)**: This is the ethical soul of the project.
    - **[The Operational Framework](compliance/cacf_compliance/CACF_Framework.md)**: The core operational rules and metrics.
    - **[The Foundational Guide](compliance/cacf_foundations/AFL-1_CACF_Guide.md)**: A deep dive into the constitutional and philosophical underpinnings.

4.  **[The Rollout Timeline](docs/rollout_timeline.md)**: This document outlines the phased, operational plan for implementing the framework at a national scale.
